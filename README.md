# project-manager
Project Manager example application in React following a Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/

## General
The application uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and only [useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) and [useRef](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef) to manage State. This is done to illustrate how complex state can get without more scalable solutions such as [useContext](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext).
